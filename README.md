DESCRIPTION : A Python script can automate data processing by reading raw information from an external file—such as CSV, text, or JSON—and performing analytical operations on it, including summarization, statistical calculations, or pattern detection. After completing the analysis, the script can generate a clean, professional PDF report using the ReportLab library. ReportLab allows the creation of structured documents by adding titles, paragraphs, tables, and charts with precise control over layout and formatting. The script typically loads the file, processes the data using Python’s built-in or external libraries, and then uses ReportLab’s SimpleDocTemplate, Paragraph, and Table classes to assemble the report. Custom styling, such as fonts, colors, and spacing, can be applied through ReportLab’s style sheets. This approach is ideal for producing automated reports for business insights, academic analysis, or data monitoring systems, ensuring consistency, readability, and reproducibility with minimal manual effort.
